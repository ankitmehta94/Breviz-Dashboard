    Anthony: Okay, so they like the idea like I said the having a split it up with two people.
    00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.460
    Anthony: we're going to, I think, set up a meeting at 105 like right after digital marketing on Monday to recap and regroup about it.
    00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.820
    Anthony: So we'll just try and have everything sort of like work through on Sunday, not everything, but like a first draft of what we think about each topic.
    00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.590
    Anthony: A strategy or something like that, so, if you look at the document we split it up a little bit brandon is going to take display pretty much on his own because it's we're going to give it a little less attention.
    00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.830
    Anthony: Because NAB newest not doing it, I personally hate display as a channel and.
    00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.720
    Anthony: We have a few ideas for it like putting display ads on like phantom or something like that, but we're just going to kind of talk about it from a theoretical point of view.
    00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:01.230
    Anthony: You have the ones that you want it to you have email and social pierce is going to be like a reviewer for email because he said he used to do like email pretty that was like his full time job at some point or you did a lot of that.
    00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.080
    Anthony: But I think you know about it, too, because you, you know i'm sure you did that, for your for your E commerce thing right.
    00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.720
    Emma: Yes, I did email and social that's why.
    00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.680

    00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:23.610
    Anthony: brandon wanted to work on social also so he's with you on that one okay Pearson I are going to work on mobile emerging we're definitely going to talk about podcasts for that, because it's a starting from that.
    00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
    Anthony: i'm doing search because I already did some analytics stuff in the past and.
    00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.910
    Anthony: that's mentioned as part of that, but I also don't know that much about search, so I want to kind of learn about it.
    00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.430
    Anthony: yeah and I think we'll reach out to.
    00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:52.320
    Anthony: Mike next week and see if we can have a meeting with him to let him know how we're doing and like where we are so far and asked him a couple of things, first of all, we want to see if we can have his marketing intern beyond that call as well.
    00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.700
    Anthony: Okay, we can coordinate with her a little bit, and then we just want to ask him, like.
    00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.540
    Anthony: You know, we didn't realize that we were kind of just supposed to write this from a theoretical point of view, like here's what we would do.
    00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.650
    Anthony: But if we want to actually take a day or two and like run a campaign, what would you actually want us to do that on like which channel and how much budget.
    00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:21.810
    Anthony: Okay, so we'll kind of get through all of that, with her or with with him and his intern if we if she can be on it Okay, but basically just coordinate with.
    00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.510
    Anthony: brandon pretty much brandon.
    00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.240
    Anthony: If you want to just take a first pass that email is pure said you like doesn't want to do too much on that because he's already done it before.
    00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.200
    Anthony: So if you want to take a first pass at that and just.
    00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.250
    Anthony: I don't know what you mentioned about what they've done already, but yeah.
    00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.190
    Emma: yeah I mean like I feel like for me an email and social i've done it before, but I also feel that.
    00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.490
    Emma: there's a lot that's different here in the US, and I would just kind of like to get that perspective, but you guys take things really deep.
    00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.310

    Emma: This is not just a.
    00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:14.820
    Emma: Nigerian perspective, this is me like approaching this from a global perspective so that's why I kind of want to hone in on stuff that I feel like I already know just to be sure that I do know that boy, and then yes search.
    00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.470
    Emma: I don't think that I can process search and display right now I wouldn't have minded the mobile because that's also very interesting, especially like.
    00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.860
    Emma: Back home, a lot of I mean the world generally mobile fest and like more so, Nick and developing countries so it's definitely something that one should explore.

    JOHN: Well you know the background stuff, so I'll make it brief. In what I call my first lifetime, I aged to about thirty-five. What you see. I ended up leading my group. They saw me as magical. I didn't even have to fight for it. Then, fear came. And they chased me away. They thought that I was...stealing their lives away to stay young.
