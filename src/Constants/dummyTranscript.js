const Transcripts  = ` | Anthony: Okay, so they like the idea like I said the having a split it up with two people.we're going to, I think, set up a meeting at 105 like right after digital marketing on Monday to recap and regroup about it.So we'll just try and have everything sort of like work through on Sunday, not everything, but like a first draft of what we think about each topic.A strategy or something like that, so, if you look at the document we split it up a little bit brandon is going to take display pretty much on his own because it's we're going to give it a little less attention.Because NAB newest not doing it, I personally hate display as a channel and.We have a few ideas for it like putting display ads on like phantom or something like that, but we're just going to kind of talk about it from a theoretical point of view.You have the ones that you want it to you have email and social pierce is going to be like a reviewer for email because he said he used to do like email pretty that was like his full time job at some point or you did a lot of that.But I think you know about it, too, because you, you know i'm sure you did that, for your for your E commerce thing right. 
| Emma: Yes, I did email and social that's why. 
| Anthony: We go.brandon wanted to work on social also so he's with you on that one okay Pearson I are going to work on mobile emerging we're definitely going to talk about podcasts for that, because it's a starting from that.i'm doing search because I already did some analytics stuff in the past and.that's mentioned as part of that, but I also don't know that much about search, so I want to kind of learn about it.yeah and I think we'll reach out to.Mike next week and see if we can have a meeting with him to let him know how we're doing and like where we are so far and asked him a couple of things, first of all, we want to see if we can have his marketing intern beyond that call as well.Okay, we can coordinate with her a little bit, and then we just want to ask him, like.You know, we didn't realize that we were kind of just supposed to write this from a theoretical point of view, like here's what we would do.But if we want to actually take a day or two and like run a campaign, what would you actually want us to do that on like which channel and how much budget.Okay, so we'll kind of get through all of that, with her or with with him and his intern if we if she can be on it Okay, but basically just coordinate with.brandon pretty much brandon.If you want to just take a first pass that email is pure said you like doesn't want to do too much on that because he's already done it before.So if you want to take a first pass at that and just.I don't know what you mentioned about what they've done already, but yeah. 
| Emma: yeah I mean like I feel like for me an email and social i've done it before, but I also feel that.there's a lot that's different here in the US, and I would just kind of like to get that perspective, but you guys take things really deep.Yes.Right, so I want to make sure that I get defined like okay Mike okay Okay, I get this like.This is not just a.Nigerian perspective, this is me like approaching this from a global perspective so that's why I kind of want to hone in on stuff that I feel like I already know just to be sure that I do know that boy, and then yes search.I don't think that I can process search and display right now I wouldn't have minded the mobile because that's also very interesting, especially like.Back home, a lot of I mean the world generally mobile fest and like more so, Nick and developing countries so it's definitely something that one should explore.yeah okay so outreach I think our work on the email maybe over the weekend and then get out of the late, and I can also post on social. 
| Anthony: Maybe junior brennan said he was going to start.Probably pretty much on Sunday, so if you want to just kind of have a call with him that are like slack with him or whatever.I don't know if he really sees the slack messages so maybe just. 
| Emma: yeah but. 
| Anthony: No worries, you know this there's plenty of like research on like reports about how email is done in the US, these days, and like just you definitely want to mention just like triggered stuff because that's. `
