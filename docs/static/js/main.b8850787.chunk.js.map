regroup about it.\n    00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.820\n    Anthony: So we'll just try and have everything sort of like work through on Sunday, not everything, but like a first draft of what we think about each topic.\n    00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.590\n    Anthony: A strategy or something like that, so, if you look at the document we split it up a little bit brandon is going to take display pretty much on his own because it's we're going to give it a little less attention.\n    00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.830\n    Anthony: Because NAB newest not doing it, I personally hate display as a

00:01:10.680\n    Anthony: We go.\n    00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:23.610\n    Anthony: brandon wanted to work on social also so he's with you on that one okay Pearson I are going to work on mobile emerging we're definitely going to talk about podcasts for that, because it's a starting from that.\n    00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310\n    Anthony: i'm doing search because I already did some analytics stuff in the past and.\n    00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.910\n    Anthony: that's mentioned as part of that, but I also don't know that much about search, so I want to kind of learn about it.\n    00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.430\n    Anthony: yeah and I think we'll reach out to.\n    00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:52.320\n    Anthony: Mike next week and see if we can have a meeting with him to let him know how we're doing and like where we are so far and asked him a couple of things, first of all, we want to see if we can have his marketing intern beyond that call as well.\n    00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.700\n    Anthony: Okay, we can coordinate with her a little bit, and then we just want to ask him, like.\n    00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.540\n    Anthony: You know, we didn't realize that we were kind of just supposed to write this from a theoretical point of view, like here's what we would do.\n    00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.650\n    Anthony: But if we want to actually take a day or two and like run a campaign, what would you actually want us to do that on like which channel and how much budget.\n    00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:21.810\n    Anthony: Okay, so we'll kind of get through all of that, with her or with with him and his intern if we if she can be on it Okay, but basically just coordinate with.\n    00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.510\n    Anthony: brandon pretty much brandon.\n    00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.240\n    Anthony: If you want to just take a first pass that email is pure said you like doesn't want to do too much on that because he's already done it before.\n    00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.200\n    Anthony: So if you want to take a first pass at that and just.\n    00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.250\n    Anthony: I don't know what you mentioned about what they've done already, but yeah.\n    00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.190\n    Emma: yeah I mean like I feel like for me an email and social i've done it before, but I also feel that.\n    00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.490\n    Emma: there's a lot that's different here in the US, and I would just kind of like to get that perspective, but you guys take things really deep.\n    00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.310\n    Emma: Yes.\n    00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.070\n    Emma: Right, so I want to make sure that I get defined like okay Mike okay Okay, I get this like.\n    00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.360\n    Emma: This is not just a.\n    00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:14.820\n    Emma: Nigerian perspective, this is me like approaching this from a global perspective so that's why I kind of want to hone in on stuff that I feel like I already know just to be sure that I do know that boy, and then yes search.\n    00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.470\n    Emma: I don't think that I can process search and display right now I wouldn't have minded the mobile because that's also very interesting, especially like.\n    00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.860\n    Emma: Back home, a lot of I mean the world generally mobile fest and like more so, Nick and developing countries so it's definitely something that one should explore.\n    00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:41.220\n    Emma: yeah okay so outreach I think our work on the email maybe over the weekend and then get out of the late, and I can also post on social.\n    00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.470\n    Anthony: Maybe junior brennan said he was going to start.\n    00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.810\n    Anthony: Probably pretty much on Sunday, so if you want to just kind of have a call with him that are like slack with him or whatever.\n    00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.510\n    Anthony: I don't know if he really sees the slack messages so maybe just.\n    00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.830\n    Emma: yeah but.\n    00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:03.720\n    Anthony: No worries, you know this there's plenty of like research on like reports about how email is done in the US, these days, and like just you definitely want to mention just like triggered stuff because that's.`,\n  },\n

file type work I.\n    \n    00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.070\n    Ankit Mehta: Do I mean to save it as like a PDF for.\n    \n    00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.830\n    Ankit Mehta: Every file type books okay.\n    \n    00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.020\n    Victor Rieman: i'll do i'll do a PDF.\n    \n    00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.850\n    Ankit Mehta: And you can do multiple files to that.\n    \n

00:03:48.930\n    Ankit Mehta: The gas in our last meeting if we could upload like PDF versions of like the source or things like that i'm not hundred percent sure what the reason for exactly the file is, but like it's fine it's basically that are talking about the source and.\n    \n    00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.970\n    Ankit Mehta: Things like that right.\n    \n    00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.950\n    Victor Rieman: yeah so I did a.\n    \n    00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:04.350\n    Victor Rieman: I took the web page that the Bloomberg sources, and then I did a like I printed it I hit print and then I saved it as a PDF just have like a backup of the web page.\n    \n    00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.540\n    Johnnie Kallas: Oh, do you do that for maybe I should start doing that okay that makes sense.\n    \n    00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.330\n    Victor Rieman: I haven't been doing it for the Bloomberg ones, but it.\n    \n    00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.020\n    Victor Rieman: might not be a bad idea, just to be consistent, that I do that.\n    \n    00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.060\n    Ankit Mehta: So, open up a negative agenda put another link just open that up.\n    \n    00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.050\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.430\n    Victor Rieman: i'm.\n    \n    00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.970\n    Ankit Mehta: Just copy paste and player place it on this chrome screen, so that, like we can also say I.\n    \n    00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.960\n    Victor Rieman: can catch it.\n    \n    00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.770\n    Ankit Mehta: So this is.\n    \n    00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.050\n    Ankit Mehta: The.\n    \n    00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.780\n    Ankit Mehta: folder that we've shared guru form.\n    \n    00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.850\n    Ankit Mehta: strike tracker form the folder.\n    \n    00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.120\n    Ankit Mehta: file responses.\n    \n    00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.250\n    Ankit Mehta: This is where it's stored.\n    \n    00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:15.510\n    Ankit Mehta: My resume is also there was also testing testing it, but I just wanted to show you this is where it will be, and it will have the same exact name of the file that you uploaded so there's no way to like tell that like which which location tracks, to which file all right.\n    \n    00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.070\n    Ankit Mehta: I mean i'm going to look into maybe if it's possible to do that, but right now that's not not something that I can do right now.\n    \n    00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.310\n    Victor Rieman: Okay, look at what actually is.\n    \n    00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.470\n    Ankit Mehta: But yeah So this is the simple research okay i'm gonna give you another.\n    \n    00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.560\n    Ankit Mehta: Link right now open that up to.\n    \n    00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.280\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah good, so this is what like the responses will look like it will have.\n    \n    00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.420\n    Ankit Mehta: The timestamp of when it got added into who added it and then keep scrolling horizontally.\n    \n    00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.810\n    Ankit Mehta: So you can see.\n    \n    00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:06.360\n    Ankit Mehta: lat long was immediately added I mean doesn't immediately it takes about like three to four seconds to actually get done, but he keeps lowering.\n    \n    00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.050\n    Ankit Mehta: All right, so you see the edit link.\n    \n    00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.720\n    Ankit Mehta: click on that.\n    \n    00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.160\n    Ankit Mehta: So this is how you would be editing things.\n    \n    00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.410\n    Ankit Mehta: So I mean change anything, I mean doesn't really matter so like yeah.\n    \n    00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.610\n    Victor Rieman: i'm just here in change the name of the employer.\n    \n    00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.130\n    Johnnie Kallas: So this is when we want to add additional information after the fact, or change things, yes, great.\n    \n    00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.100\n    Ankit Mehta: Every database needs that perfect.\n    \n    00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.550\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah you can go to that I should.\n    \n    00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.540\n    Johnnie Kallas: And we access that from the spreadsheet.\n    \n    00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.340\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah.\n    \n    00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.080\n    Ankit Mehta: Ideally, what I would like to do is remove everyone's right permissions for this fight.\n    \n    00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:19.320\n    Ankit Mehta: So, no one can actually make changes to this file, except for like me technically or like whoever is like the authorized person so like at some point of time this form will have to change owners and.\n    \n    00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.080\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah whoever that person is.\n    \n    00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:35.490\n    Ankit Mehta: Should like would get this Okay, so I think, at least for the normal workflow this is working it's usable as on issue right and I just realized go to the very end.\n    \n    00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.180\n    Ankit Mehta: Good yeah just Dr dot Google where it's written right.\n    \n    00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.230\n    Victor Rieman: This one.\n    \n    00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.220\n    Ankit Mehta: No, no next one.\n    \n    00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.320\n    Ankit Mehta: Okay yeah yeah that's your file so file is also getting stored non issue.\n    \n    00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.580\n    Victor Rieman: Oh Nice.\n    \n    00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:59.280\n    Ankit Mehta: I don't know how we would do this for multiple but yeah Okay, so all of that works out.\n    \n    00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:08.280\n    Ankit Mehta: Now, can you do it for like the multiple one actually was trying to test this myself, but I really couldn't understand.\n    \n    00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.250\n    Ankit Mehta: The way you to actually return the addresses for that thing.\n    \n    00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.420\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.910\n    Ankit Mehta: Yes, the summit another response.\n    \n    00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.250\n    Victor Rieman: So, this would be the.\n    \n    00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.540\n    Ankit Mehta: 11th one is the one that i'm actually talking about on the normal strike.\n    \n    00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.020\n    Victor Rieman: location one yeah okay.\n    \n    00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:46.080\n    Ankit Mehta: This will take you a bit because you have 11 strike positions, so this is possibly so you if you want, since the nothing else changes you don't need to write down everything just me if you want to do the addresses because everything is the same that also works for me.\n    \n    00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.370\n    Victor Rieman: Okay yeah this is.\n    \n    00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.070\n    Ankit Mehta: More like waste your time too much.\n    \n    00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:11.880\n    Victor Rieman: So we should I do the thing with a every addresses separated by the semi colon yes okay i'll just copy and paste it then the way was inputted because I Oh well, Okay, the address part is right i'm going to have to change it for the.\n    \n    00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:18.060\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah, but you will have to remove the city's from this too and you'll have to remove the zip codes and you'll have to remove it or not.\n    \n    00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.820\n    Ankit Mehta: OK OK.\n    \n    00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.570\n    i'm.\n    \n    00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.410\n    Victor Rieman: Here, let me.\n    \n    00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:34.500\n    Ankit Mehta: This is only if capturing cities separately, is important if it's just okay being like one string then.\n    \n    00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:48.870\n    Ankit Mehta: I don't see the problem in just doing this, where it's everything is together it's technically they're less going for me, but if you want to capture stuff separate like for like at least four states, it would be important, because we want to filter by state.\n    \n    00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.360\n    Ankit Mehta: But otherwise that's why we need if we want to filter by anything we need a separate points.\n    \n    00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.570\n    Ankit Mehta: And yeah if it's repeated Chicago then like just repeat Chicago as many times as you need it.\n    \n    00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:10.500\n    Victor Rieman: yeah I mean I would be okay with us just getting rid of the city, then so, then the address contains all of it, but maybe so have stayed separate in the future.\n    \n    00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:17.130\n    Ankit Mehta: john, what do you think if that's okay with you, if you don't need to capture cities, specifically.\n    \n    00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.500\n    Ankit Mehta: separately.\n    \n    00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.980\n    Johnnie Kallas: i'm sorry to be a pain in the ass you guys, but can we keep cities for now.\n    \n    00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:35.700\n    Ankit Mehta: I mean it's not an issue for me because i've already done all the required coding for this song an extra.\n    \n    00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.980\n    Johnnie Kallas: Then Victor i'm sorry to be a pain in the ass for you and.\n    \n    00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.270\n    Victor Rieman: Hopefully we don't have many of these again.\n    \n    00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.630\n    Johnnie Kallas: want me to read them out to you how would I do that.\n    \n    00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.770\n    Victor Rieman: yeah sure it's I think oaklawn Illinois where I am right now.\n    \n    00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.330\n    Johnnie Kallas: yeah then Chicago.\n    \n    00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.700\n    Johnnie Kallas: Okay, it looks like bloomingdale.\n    \n    00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.290\n    Johnnie Kallas: Then.\n    \n    00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.420\n    Johnnie Kallas: Is that pit task, I think it a SCA.\n    \n    00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.310\n    Johnnie Kallas: Then moments mo m E MC.\n    \n    00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.170\n    Ankit Mehta: One that'd be seen moments.\n    \n    00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.140\n    Johnnie Kallas: um.\n    \n    00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.670\n    Victor Rieman: I think it's walnut street.\n    \n    00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.230\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:34.980\n    Ankit Mehta: See that's what was confusing me because I was like is it locked up bloomingdale that doesn't make sense for the city's name.\n    \n    00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.650\n    Johnnie Kallas: And then streeter str EA to our.\n    \n    00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.440\n    Victor Rieman: I think that's 11 then.\n    \n    00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.940\n    Victor Rieman: yeah yep.\n    \n    00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.890\n    Ankit Mehta: You can just copy paste Illinois like 11 times.\n    \n    00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.800\n    Victor Rieman: Oh right I just.\n    \n    00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.900\n    Ankit Mehta: copy this and then just yeah.\n    \n    00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.150\n    Johnnie Kallas: don't scroll down for zip code, so I can read all of them out to you because I can see him right now.\n    \n    00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.430\n    Johnnie Kallas: Okay, you ready.\n    \n    00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.340\n    Johnnie Kallas: yep 60714.\n    \n    00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.050\n    Victor Rieman: Okay.\n    \n    00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:42.180\n    Johnnie Kallas: 6080460614 606-256-0625 again.\n    \n    00:12:44.340 --> 00:13:03.630\n    Johnnie Kallas: 604 or 536064360108 601-436-0954.\n    \n    00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:15.750\n    Ankit Mehta: And finally 613648 to do this, but you'd also have to remove all of this information from the addresses.\n    \n    00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.150\n    Victor Rieman: Okay, I get it in.\n    \n    00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.860\n    Ankit Mehta: A job just leave the semi colon.\n    \n    00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.980\n    Johnnie Kallas: You need a semi colon here for the last one on kid or now.\n    \n    00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.540\n    Ankit Mehta: You actually don't put it in the last one okay.\n    \n    00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.570\n    Victor Rieman: Okay, this one.\n    \n    00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.980\n    Ankit Mehta: Oh cool just summit.\n    \n    00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.280\n    Ankit Mehta: And do do me a favor.\n    \n    00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.300\n    Ankit Mehta: Right click on the edit your response fit.\n    \n    00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.340\n    Ankit Mehta: And then copy link address.\n    \n    00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.100\n    Victor Rieman: Okay, send it to me.\n    \n    00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.740\n    Ankit Mehta: Like to put in the chat.\n    \n    00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.430\n    yeah.\n    \n    00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.080\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.100\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.270\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah just click on the latitude longitude.\n    \n    00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.310\n    shit.\n    \n    00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.160\n    Ankit Mehta: Okay.\n    \n    00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.380\n    Ankit Mehta: All right, um it did not work so i'll have to see why.\n    \n    00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.150\n    Ankit Mehta: Okay, so.\n    \n    00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.690\n    Ankit Mehta: This is using usable for you guys right.\n    \n    00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.130\n    Victor Rieman: yeah.\n    \n    00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:09.720\n    Absolutely.\n    \n    00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.150\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:22.350\n    Ankit Mehta: All right, alright i'm not done yet, because I mean clearly there's some problem that's come up, but I will fix it and then probably.\n    \n    00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:31.950\n    Ankit Mehta: end of this week, I should have some like you can start filling it in um How would you want to move data from one place to the other.\n    \n    00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:47.370\n    Ankit Mehta: There are two options one option is obviously the copy paste the sheet one end to the other, which would still take some effort, because we don't have all the same columns right now we definitely would not have the.\n    \n    00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:58.860\n    Ankit Mehta: anytime in the same model, but we definitely would not have the edit link at that point of time, the other way, is doing it for every form one by one, but that's like at forms to fill.\n    \n    00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:07.470\n    Ankit Mehta: So, but that way you would always have an edit link for this, so this is basically.\n    \n    00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.960\n    The.\n    \n    00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:11.790\n    Question right now.\n    \n    00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.540\n    Johnnie Kallas: i'm.\n    \n    00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.820\n    Ankit Mehta: happy to answer to me right now think about it.\n    \n    00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.040\n    Johnnie Kallas: yeah sounds good, one thing.\n    \n    00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:31.860\n    Ankit Mehta: Because yeah I mean the edit link is the only option so like at some point of time if you're Okay, if you don't want anyone to mess, with the data is the best thing is to do is.\n    \n    00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:43.410\n    Ankit Mehta: Only let one person control it right like one person enters and like removes the data which would be the form itself the code that is behind the form.\n    \n    00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:56.730\n    Ankit Mehta: And if we do that, then we have to fill it formed by one by one, for the form, if you just need the sheet open, at least initially, then you wouldn't have edit links for any of those first at.\n    \n    00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.650\n    Ankit Mehta: Things that we input.\n    \n    00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.270\n    Johnnie Kallas: And the other banks are what you need to make out yeah.\n    \n    00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:14.010\n    Ankit Mehta: Because if you pages copy paste into this, then I don't think we can edit them they'd like from the then the edit form won't be generated because there was no form.\n    \n    00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:27.180\n    Johnnie Kallas: So I think what we'll do Victor if you can try and I know you're busy this week, but if you can make your one priority this week to just fill in those end dates like we talked about if you're able to, or just filling.\n    \n    00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:38.010\n    Johnnie Kallas: there's a couple other missing information that I actually need to talk through at our next meeting, but fill in whatever you can fill in that's not filled in and i'll take the leadership on transferring everything over yeah.\n    \n    00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.460\n    Ankit Mehta: don't.\n    \n    00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.050\n    Ankit Mehta: I got night now.\n    \n    00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:47.010\n    Johnnie Kallas: let's complete yeah yeah until you give me the go ahead on can I won't do anything but when you do i'll take care of that alright.\n    \n    00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.850\n    Ankit Mehta: Alright, this was everything that I needed to see for now.\n    \n    00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.530\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah.\n    \n    00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:04.290\n    Ankit Mehta: i'll just fix what whatever this problem is and then it never yeah and then I contact you never works on the first never.\n    \n    00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.800\n    Johnnie Kallas: I thought it seems like it's working just besides the.\n    \n    00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.400\n    Ankit Mehta: Multiple location location is the thing that i'm complaining.\n    \n    00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:18.090\n    Johnnie Kallas: yeah I mean this looks great to me so good work, and this will make it easier on our part in the long run to.\n    \n    00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:21.600\n    Victor Rieman: alright.\n    \n    00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.270\n    Johnnie Kallas: Alright, thanks guys talk to you next week.\n    `,\n  },\n};\nexport default Summaries;\n","export const UPDATE_SUMMARY
