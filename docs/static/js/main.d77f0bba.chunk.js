Ankit Mehta: folder that we've shared guru form.\n    \n    00:04:48.930 --\x3e 00:04:50.850\n    Ankit Mehta: strike tracker form the folder.\n    \n    00:04:52.950 --\x3e 00:04:54.120\n    Ankit Mehta: file responses.\n    \n    00:04:55.200 --\x3e 00:04:56.250\n    Ankit Mehta: This is where it's stored.\n    \n    00:04:57.540 --\x3e 00:05:15.510\n    Ankit Mehta: My resume is also there was also testing testing it, but I just wanted to show you this is where it will be, and it will have the same exact name of the file that you uploaded so there's no way to like tell that like which which location tracks, to which file all right.\n    \n    00:05:16.650 --\x3e 00:05:23.070\n    Ankit Mehta: I mean i'm going to look into maybe if it's possible to do that, but right now that's not not something that I can do right now.\n    \n    00:05:23.940 --\x3e 00:05:26.310\n    Victor Rieman: Okay, look at what actually is.\n    \n    00:05:26.760 --\x3e 00:05:31.470\n    Ankit Mehta: But yeah So this is the simple research okay i'm gonna give you another.\n    \n    00:05:32.520 --\x3e 00:05:34.560\n    Ankit Mehta: Link right now open that up to.\n    \n    00:05:42.690 --\x3e 00:05:47.280\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah good, so this is what like the responses will look like it will have.\n    \n    00:05:48.300 --\x3e 00:05:54.420\n    Ankit Mehta: The timestamp of when it got added into who added it and then keep scrolling horizontally.\n    \n    00:05:56.820 --\x3e 00:05:57.810\n    Ankit Mehta: So you can see.\n    \n    00:05:59.010 --\x3e 00:06:06.360\n    Ankit Mehta: lat long was immediately added I mean doesn't immediately it takes about like three to four seconds to actually get done, but he keeps lowering.\n    \n    00:06:13.590 --\x3e 00:06:16.050\n    Ankit Mehta: All right, so you see the edit link.\n    \n    00:06:18.120 --\x3e 00:06:18.720\n    Ankit Mehta: click on that.\n    \n    00:06:23.100 --\x3e 00:06:26.160\n    Ankit Mehta: So this is how you would be editing things.\n    \n    00:06:27.720 --\x3e 00:06:31.410\n    Ankit Mehta: So I mean change anything, I mean doesn't really matter so like yeah.\n    \n    00:06:32.160 --\x3e 00:06:35.610\n    Victor Rieman: i'm just here in change the name of the employer.\n    \n    00:06:38.220 --\x3e 00:06:44.130\n    Johnnie Kallas: So this is when we want to add additional information after the fact, or change things, yes, great.\n    \n    00:06:44.310 --\x3e 00:06:47.100\n    Ankit Mehta: Every database needs that perfect.\n    \n    00:06:48.570 --\x3e 00:06:50.550\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah you can go to that I should.\n    \n    00:06:52.410 --\x3e 00:06:54.540\n    Johnnie Kallas: And we access that from the spreadsheet.\n    \n    00:06:55.980 --\x3e 00:06:56.340\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah.\n    \n    00:06:58.560 --\x3e 00:07:04.080\n    Ankit Mehta: Ideally, what I would like to do is remove everyone's right permissions for this fight.\n    \n    00:07:05.250 --\x3e 00:07:19.320\n    Ankit Mehta: So, no one can actually make changes to this file, except for like me technically or like whoever is like the authorized person so like at some point of time this form will have to change owners and.\n    \n    00:07:20.400 --\x3e 00:07:22.080\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah whoever that person is.\n    \n    00:07:24.060 --\x3e 00:07:35.490\n    Ankit Mehta: Should like would get this Okay, so I think, at least for the normal workflow this is working it's usable as on issue right and I just realized go to the very end.\n    \n    00:07:39.270 --\x3e 00:07:42.180\n    Ankit Mehta: Good yeah just Dr dot Google where it's written right.\n    \n    00:07:42.780 --\x3e 00:07:43.230\n    Victor Rieman: This one.\n    \n    00:07:43.410 --\x3e 00:07:44.220\n    Ankit Mehta: No, no next one.\n    \n    00:07:44.670 --\x3e 00:07:49.320\n    Ankit Mehta: Okay yeah yeah that's your file so file is also getting stored non issue.\n    \n    00:07:49.830 --\x3e 00:07:50.580\n    Victor Rieman: Oh Nice.\n    \n    00:07:53.730 --\x3e 00:07:59.280\n    Ankit Mehta: I don't know how we would do this for multiple but yeah Okay, so all of that works out.\n    \n    00:08:00.300 --\x3e 00:08:08.280\n    Ankit Mehta: Now, can you do it for like the multiple one actually was trying to test this myself, but I really couldn't understand.\n    \n    00:08:09.990 --\x3e 00:08:14.250\n    Ankit Mehta: The way you to actually return the addresses for that thing.\n    \n    00:08:15.150 --\x3e 00:08:15.420\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:08:16.470 --\x3e 00:08:17.910\n    Ankit Mehta: Yes, the summit another response.\n    \n    00:08:19.320 --\x3e 00:08:20.250\n    Victor Rieman: So, this would be the.\n    \n    00:08:21.210 --\x3e 00:08:24.540\n    Ankit Mehta: 11th one is the one that i'm actually talking about on the normal strike.\n    \n    00:08:25.590 --\x3e 00:08:28.020\n    Victor Rieman: location one yeah okay.\n    \n    00:08:29.130 --\x3e 00:08:46.080\n    Ankit Mehta: This will take you a bit because you have 11 strike positions, so this is possibly so you if you want, since the nothing else changes you don't need to write down everything just me if you want to do the addresses because everything is the same that also works for me.\n    \n    00:08:46.110 --\x3e 00:08:47.370\n    Victor Rieman: Okay yeah this is.\n    \n    00:08:47.850 --\x3e 00:08:50.070\n    Ankit Mehta: More like waste your time too much.\n    \n    00:08:56.580 --\x3e 00:09:11.880\n    Victor Rieman: So we should I do the thing with a every addresses separated by the semi colon yes okay i'll just copy and paste it then the way was inputted because I Oh well, Okay, the address part is right i'm going to have to change it for the.\n    \n    00:09:12.210 --\x3e 00:09:18.060\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah, but you will have to remove the city's from this too and you'll have to remove the zip codes and you'll have to remove it or not.\n    \n    00:09:19.980 --\x3e 00:09:20.820\n    Ankit Mehta: OK OK.\n    \n    00:09:21.000 --\x3e 00:09:21.570\n    i'm.\n    \n    00:09:23.820 --\x3e 00:09:25.410\n    Victor Rieman: Here, let me.\n    \n    00:09:26.160 --\x3e 00:09:34.500\n    Ankit Mehta: This is only if capturing cities separately, is important if it's just okay being like one string then.\n    \n    00:09:35.130 --\x3e 00:09:48.870\n    Ankit Mehta: I don't see the problem in just doing this, where it's everything is together it's technically they're less going for me, but if you want to capture stuff separate like for like at least four states, it would be important, because we want to filter by state.\n    \n    00:09:50.160 --\x3e 00:09:54.360\n    Ankit Mehta: But otherwise that's why we need if we want to filter by anything we need a separate points.\n    \n    00:09:56.370 --\x3e 00:10:00.570\n    Ankit Mehta: And yeah if it's repeated Chicago then like just repeat Chicago as many times as you need it.\n    \n    00:10:00.750 --\x3e 00:10:10.500\n    Victor Rieman: yeah I mean I would be okay with us just getting rid of the city, then so, then the address contains all of it, but maybe so have stayed separate in the future.\n    \n    00:10:11.430 --\x3e 00:10:17.130\n    Ankit Mehta: john, what do you think if that's okay with you, if you don't need to capture cities, specifically.\n    \n    00:10:18.840 --\x3e 00:10:19.500\n    Ankit Mehta: separately.\n    \n    00:10:22.800 --\x3e 00:10:25.980\n    Johnnie Kallas: i'm sorry to be a pain in the ass you guys, but can we keep cities for now.\n    \n    00:10:28.020 --\x3e 00:10:35.700\n    Ankit Mehta: I mean it's not an issue for me because i've already done all the required coding for this song an extra.\n    \n    00:10:38.160 --\x3e 00:10:40.980\n    Johnnie Kallas: Then Victor i'm sorry to be a pain in the ass for you and.\n    \n    00:10:43.800 --\x3e 00:10:45.270\n    Victor Rieman: Hopefully we don't have many of these again.\n    \n    00:10:52.530 --\x3e 00:10:54.630\n    Johnnie Kallas: want me to read them out to you how would I do that.\n    \n    00:10:55.410 --\x3e 00:10:58.770\n    Victor Rieman: yeah sure it's I think oaklawn Illinois where I am right now.\n    \n    00:10:58.980 --\x3e 00:11:00.330\n    Johnnie Kallas: yeah then Chicago.\n    \n    00:11:02.430 --\x3e 00:11:05.700\n    Johnnie Kallas: Okay, it looks like bloomingdale.\n    \n    00:11:09.630 --\x3e 00:11:10.290\n    Johnnie Kallas: Then.\n    \n    00:11:11.340 --\x3e 00:11:15.420\n    Johnnie Kallas: Is that pit task, I think it a SCA.\n    \n    00:11:16.620 --\x3e 00:11:20.310\n    Johnnie Kallas: Then moments mo m E MC.\n    \n    00:11:20.550 --\x3e 00:11:22.170\n    Ankit Mehta: One that'd be seen moments.\n    \n    00:11:24.270 --\x3e 00:11:25.140\n    Johnnie Kallas: um.\n    \n    00:11:25.320 --\x3e 00:11:26.670\n    Victor Rieman: I think it's walnut street.\n    \n    00:11:27.570 --\x3e 00:11:28.230\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:11:29.250 --\x3e 00:11:34.980\n    Ankit Mehta: See that's what was confusing me because I was like is it locked up bloomingdale that doesn't make sense for the city's name.\n    \n    00:11:36.930 --\x3e 00:11:40.650\n    Johnnie Kallas: And then streeter str EA to our.\n    \n    00:11:41.910 --\x3e 00:11:43.440\n    Victor Rieman: I think that's 11 then.\n    \n    00:11:47.190 --\x3e 00:11:47.940\n    Victor Rieman: yeah yep.\n    \n    00:11:49.380 --\x3e 00:11:52.890\n    Ankit Mehta: You can just copy paste Illinois like 11 times.\n    \n    00:11:54.240 --\x3e 00:11:55.800\n    Victor Rieman: Oh right I just.\n    \n    00:11:56.730 --\x3e 00:11:57.900\n    Ankit Mehta: copy this and then just yeah.\n    \n    00:12:13.620 --\x3e 00:12:18.150\n    Johnnie Kallas: don't scroll down for zip code, so I can read all of them out to you because I can see him right now.\n    \n    00:12:18.630 --\x3e 00:12:20.430\n    Johnnie Kallas: Okay, you ready.\n    \n    00:12:20.670 --\x3e 00:12:23.340\n    Johnnie Kallas: yep 60714.\n    \n    00:12:24.750 --\x3e 00:12:25.050\n    Victor Rieman: Okay.\n    \n    00:12:25.590 --\x3e 00:12:42.180\n    Johnnie Kallas: 6080460614 606-256-0625 again.\n    \n    00:12:44.340 --\x3e 00:13:03.630\n    Johnnie Kallas: 604 or 536064360108 601-436-0954.\n    \n    00:13:04.950 --\x3e 00:13:15.750\n    Ankit Mehta: And finally 613648 to do this, but you'd also have to remove all of this information from the addresses.\n    \n    00:13:17.070 --\x3e 00:13:18.150\n    Victor Rieman: Okay, I get it in.\n    \n    00:13:23.610 --\x3e 00:13:25.860\n    Ankit Mehta: A job just leave the semi colon.\n    \n    00:14:29.490 --\x3e 00:14:31.980\n    Johnnie Kallas: You need a semi colon here for the last one on kid or now.\n    \n    00:14:34.140 --\x3e 00:14:36.540\n    Ankit Mehta: You actually don't put it in the last one okay.\n    \n    00:14:41.100 --\x3e 00:14:42.570\n    Victor Rieman: Okay, this one.\n    \n    00:14:44.970 --\x3e 00:14:46.980\n    Ankit Mehta: Oh cool just summit.\n    \n    00:14:51.060 --\x3e 00:14:53.280\n    Ankit Mehta: And do do me a favor.\n    \n    00:14:54.660 --\x3e 00:14:57.300\n    Ankit Mehta: Right click on the edit your response fit.\n    \n    00:14:57.840 --\x3e 00:14:59.340\n    Ankit Mehta: And then copy link address.\n    \n    00:15:00.900 --\x3e 00:15:02.100\n    Victor Rieman: Okay, send it to me.\n    \n    00:15:03.840 --\x3e 00:15:04.740\n    Ankit Mehta: Like to put in the chat.\n    \n    00:15:05.100 --\x3e 00:15:05.430\n    yeah.\n    \n    00:15:24.780 --\x3e 00:15:25.080\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:15:28.770 --\x3e 00:15:29.100\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:15:34.140 --\x3e 00:15:36.270\n    Ankit Mehta: yeah just click on the latitude longitude.\n    \n    00:15:37.980 --\x3e 00:15:38.310\n    shit.\n    \n    00:15:40.860 --\x3e 00:15:41.160\n    Ankit Mehta: Okay.\n    \n    00:15:45.240 --\x3e 00:15:49.380\n    Ankit Mehta: All right, um it did not work so i'll have to see why.\n    \n    00:16:02.340 --\x3e 00:16:03.150\n    Ankit Mehta: Okay, so.\n    \n    00:16:04.320 --\x3e 00:16:06.690\n    Ankit Mehta: This is using usable for you guys right.\n    \n    00:16:07.770 --\x3e 00:16:08.130\n    Victor Rieman: yeah.\n    \n    00:16:09.090 --\x3e 00:16:09.720\n    Absolutely.\n    \n    00:16:11.760 --\x3e 00:16:12.150\n    Okay.\n    \n    00:16:13.650 --\x3e 00:16:22.350\n    Ankit Mehta: All right, alright i'm not done yet, because I mean clearly there's some problem that's come up, but I will fix it and then probably.\n    \n    00:16:23.430 --\x3e 00:16:31.950\n    Ankit Mehta: end of this week, I should have some like you can start filling it in um How would you want to move data from one place to the other.\n    \n    00:16:35.100 --\x3e 00:16:47.370\n    Ankit Mehta: There are two options one option is obviously the copy paste the sheet one end to the other, which would still take some effort, because we don't have all the same columns right now we definitely would not have the.\n    \n    00:16:48.150 --\x3e 00:16:58.860\n    Ankit Mehta: anytime in the same model, but we definitely would not have the edit link at that point of time, the other way, is doing it for every form one by one, but that's like at forms to fill.\n    \n    00:17:00.480 --\x3e 00:17:07.470\n    Ankit Mehta: So, but that way you would always have an edit link for this, so this is basically.\n    \n    00:17:09.510 --\x3e 00:17:09.960\n    The.\n    \n    00:17:11.010 --\x3e 00:17:11.790\n    Question right now.\n    \n    00:17:14.940 --\x3e 00:17:15.540\n    Johnnie Kallas: i'm.\n    \n    00:17:15.600 --\x3e 00:17:17.820\n    Ankit Mehta: happy to answer to me right now think about it.\n    \n    00:17:18.870 --\x3e 00:17:20.040\n    Johnnie Kallas: yeah sounds good, one thing.\n    \n    00:17:22.200 --\x3e 00:17:31.860\n    Ankit Mehta: Because yeah I mean the edit link is the only option so like at some point of time if you're Okay, if you don't want anyone to mess, with the data is the best thing is to do is.\n    \n    00:17:32.400 --\x3e 00:17:43.410\n    Ankit Mehta: Only let one person control it right like one person enters and like removes the data which would be the form itself the code that is behind the form.\n    \n    00:17:44.430 --\x3e 00:17:56.730\n    Ankit Mehta: And if we do that, then we have to fill it formed by one by one, for the form, if you just need the sheet open, at least initially,
